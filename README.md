# DS-life-expectancy-and-GDP-portfolio-project
This work is the data vizualization portfolio project for Codecademy Data Scientist path.

The repository includes the following files:
- life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb: *Jupyter Notebook with analysis description, code and figures*
- all_data.csv: *CSV file with data GDP and life expectancy data used by Jupyter Notebook*
- CC-DSpath39.yml: *conda environment used for creating the Notebook (some package are not used by this Notebook because this is the environment I used for the whole Codecademy course)*

Use the command `conda env create -f CC-DSpath39.yml` in your terminal to create the environment named `CC-DSpath39.yml`.
Activate the environment with `conda activate CC-DSpath39.yml`, navigate to the directory where `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb` is located and then launch `jupyter notebook`.
