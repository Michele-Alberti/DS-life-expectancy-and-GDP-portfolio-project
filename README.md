# Codecademy Data Science Path: Life Expectancy and GDP Portfolio Project
This work is the data vizualization portfolio project for *Codecademy Data Scientist path*.

The repository includes the following files:
- **life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb:** *Jupyter Notebook with analysis description, code and figures*
- **all_data.csv:** *CSV file with GDP and life expectancy data used by `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb`*
- **CC-DSpath39.yml:** *conda environment used for creating the Notebook (some package are not used by this Notebook because this is the environment I used for the whole Codecademy course)*

[<img src="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/_images/conda_logo.svg" alt="Conda" width="80"/>](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is required for creating the development environment (it is suggested to install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))

From terminal navigate to the repository base directory.\
Use the command `conda env create -f CC-DSpath39.yml` in your terminal to create the environment named `CC-DSpath39.yml`.\
Activate the environment with `conda activate CC-DSpath39` and then run `jupyter notebook`.
